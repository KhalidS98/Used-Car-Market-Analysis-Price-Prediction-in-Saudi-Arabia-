# ðŸš— Used Car Market Analysis & Price Prediction in Saudi Arabia  
This project explores the **used car market in Saudi Arabia**, analyzing factors that influence car prices using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning models** to predict prices.
The dataset was taken from Kaggle, collected from syarah.com
##  Objectives  
- Identify **key factors** influencing used car prices.  
- Perform  **feature engineering** to enhance model performance.  
- Compare **Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost** models.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- **Machine Learning** (scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization

 ## Conclusion we got from this dataset   
- Car brand and model dominate pricing, while numerical factors (mileage, engine size) play secondary roles.
- XGBoost is the best model, achieving an 82% accuracy in predicting used car prices.
- Mileage & Car Age â€“ Affect price but are less significant than brand/model.
- Region: Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam have the highest average prices. -Fuel Type: Hybrid and Diesel cars tend to have higher prices than gasoline cars.
- Options (Trims): Full-option cars are much more expensive than Standard versions.
- Transmission Type: Automatic cars are priced significantly higher than manual ones but not much.
